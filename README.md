# movie-list

This is my summer project, Movie List. This repository contains the backend code for an app that lets users track what movies that would like to watch and what movies they have already watched, as well as get information about them. This project uses the Cinemagoer API to retrieve movie data and implements authentication and two many-to-many relationships. There are 10 endpoints, including one base endpoint for testing, five endpoints for authentication, and four endpoints for the app functionality. The app is currently deployed using Docker and Google Cloud Services with IP 34.125.244.105. Feel free to test any and all endpoints using postman or ping the base endpoint with postman for a secret message :)
